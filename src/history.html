              It was 2006. Many local alumnae had long sought a way to donate money which would be tax deductible and would benefit area Phi Mus and our Chapter House. With no active chapter at that time, many of those same local alumnae felt an urgent need to support and protect the Eta Beta Student Residence property. They viewed that property as essential to Phi Mu’s future hopes for a return to the University of Washington campus. They wanted to support and promote educational opportunities and activities for area phi Mus – joining the efforts to keep our alumnae group engages and vibrant.
              <hr>
              Out of these hopes and desires, the Eta Beta Education Foundation was incorporated on October 9. 2006. At that time we though it would allow us to practice what it would be like to be mentors and alumnae supporting a new chapter some time in the future. 
              <hr>
              Through member donations, we’ve funded scholarships for residents at the ta Beta Student Residence. Gifts of books and study support created positive referral and a “buzz” about the benefits of renting there and contributed to the success of securing that property.
